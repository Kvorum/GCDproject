## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

run_analysis.R file contains the R code that: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, the data and transformations that were performed to clean up the data.
